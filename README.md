# Java-package-Runtime-Exceptions-
The packages organize the group of classes into a single unit for Handling the run time exceptions. Access protection will be easier. Protected and default are the access level control to the package
A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:
Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
User-defined packages: As the name proposes, user-defined packages in Java are essentially packages that are defined by the programmer. Whenever we want to add a class to the package, we must mention the package name and the “package” keyword at the program's top.
Runtime errors occur when something goes wrong in the normal execution of a program. When severe enough, these errors abruptly terminate an application.
To help programmers both anticipate and recover from runtime errors, the Java programming language defines a special class named the RuntimeException.


The packages organize the group of classes into a single unit for Handling the run time exceptions.
Access protection will be easier. Protected and default are the access level control to the package
Easy to locate the related classes in our project.
Reuse the existing classes in packages to handle our exceptions.
OUR APPLICATION IS A USER-DEFINED PACKAGE ON RUNTIME EXCEPTION.

WITH THE HELP OF OUR PACKAGE WE HANDLE THE RUN TIME EXCEPTIONS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN OUR PACKAGE.
